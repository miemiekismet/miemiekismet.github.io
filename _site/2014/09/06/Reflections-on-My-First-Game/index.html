  <p>Hmm..Here is the thing…I made a game recently.</p>

<p>And I put it on <a href="http://awu.so/Journey/">http://awu.so/Journey/</a>.</p>

<p>The whole process is super exciting for me.</p>

<p>I enjoyed every second when I play with it.</p>

<p>But…</p>

<p>it turns out not as good as I expected.</p>

<p>So I finally stop refining it and start to reflect on the whole thing.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>The basic game flow was completed.</p>

<p>In the game you travels from town to town, and trade goods in towns’ markets. When travels you will meet monsters, you will fight monsters by play a game similar to puzzle and dragon. And you will get loot after fight.\n</p>

<p>The first problem is that, there is two game system in the game: the trade system and the fight system.</p>

<p>The trade system is that goods types and prices varies, so you can speculate on them.</p>

<p>The fight system is quite tricky game.</p>

<p>Both these two parts can be a single game. Now they are distracting.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>The second problem is, it lacks a story line as well as a growth curve. This problem was on the TO FIX LIST. But I may not fix it since the first problem makes the game’s integrity is not very well.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>The third problem is, the trade system calls for little amount of goods to make the trade fluent, but the fight system calls for more to make it exciting.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Making game is quite time-consuming..Source materials take a lot of time to draw or collect. Bugs need a lot of time to be found.
But most important is thinking thoroughly before you make it.
Including develop platform, game type, game screen style, story, growth curve to keep player exciting.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>I made a dream this afternoon =w=..it’s kind of a nightmare, but can be a good game.</p>

<p>In the next step, I will take some time to prepare on the new game.</p>

<p>BTW, if you see this post and play the game - Journey. Pls kindly leave some comments to me.
