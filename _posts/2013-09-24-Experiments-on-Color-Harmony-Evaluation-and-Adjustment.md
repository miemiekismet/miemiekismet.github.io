<strong>Part I: Color harmony evaluation</strong>

I evaluate two-color harmony with the theory and made a evaluation page.

The harmony score calculated is adjusted according to such a use case “It looks harmony, impressive and not eyestrain as a background color scheme for ads”.

Higher score indicates better scheme. Scheme with score lower than -0.5 is strongly not recommended. Scheme with score higher than 0.5 is quite safe and harmony.

Evaluated colors are selected from some existing web pages.
